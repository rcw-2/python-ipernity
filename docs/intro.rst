Introduction
==============

This library is a thin wrapper around
`Ipernity's API <http://www.ipernity.com/help/api/about.html>`_.
It was inspired by Wayne's
`Ipernity API <https://github.com/oneyoung/python-ipernity-api>`_ and
Sybren A. St√ºvel's `Flickr API <https://stuvel.eu/software/flickrapi/>`_.
