Running the Tests
==================

WARNING:    The tests will DELETE EVERYTHING in the Ipernity account used.
            DO NOT use your regular Ipernity account for running the tests.

Since the tests need access to Ipernity, some preparation is necessary to run
them. You need a SEPARATE Ipernity account to run the tests, too. Testing
should be done in a virtual environment. To prepare, follow this procedure:

1. Install the test requisites:

    (.venv) $ pip install -e .[test]
   
2. Create an Ipernity application on https://www.ipernity.com/apps/key
   Choose the "Software" authentication method.

3. Create another Ipernity application on https://www.ipernity.com/apps/key
   Choose the "Web" authentication method and add something beginning with
   "http://127.0.0.1" (the tests will ignore the rest) as the callback URL.

4. Login to Ipernity with "Remember me" activated. Use your browser's developer
   tools to get your ipernity cookies. You need the "s" and "ua" cookies.

5. Create a file tests/.test-config.yaml with the following contents:

    auth:
      desktop:
        api_key: "<your first application key>"
        api_secret: "<your first application secret>"
      web:
        api_key: "<your second application key>"
        api_secret: "<your second application secret>"

    user:
      user_id: "<your user id on Ipernity>"
      username: "<your display name on Ipernity>"
      cookies:
        www.ipernity.com:
          /:
            cookie_consent: ok
            s: "<your s cookie>"
            ua: "<your ua cookie>"
    
   If you cloned the repository on Github, you can pass these parameters to
   the "test" workflow as secrets.

6. After that, you should be able to run the tests with

    (.venv) $ pytest
